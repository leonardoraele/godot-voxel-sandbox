To start the project, I decided to start with the rendering.
To render a voxel space, I need an octree data structure.
I have the tendency of trying to implement my own code whenever I need something that is not supported by the standard
library, but I have implemented an quad-tree (a 2D version of the octree) in C# for another project in the past and,
although I was satisfied with the result, it was a bit complicated to get there, so I'm not very thrilling with the idea
of implementing an octree from scratch.
Also, voxels have the tendency of being very resource consuming, so I know it need a performant implementation, and
testing and optimizing data structures take time. Finally, I don't even know if a C# implementation will be enough to
achieve a satisfactory performance. If it ends up C# is not enough, I will have to throw the work away and resort to a
lower level implementation. With all that in mind, it was clear I should use an existing implementation.
I found https://github.com/mcserep/NetOctree. It looks fitting. It even has functions to check for collision. Maybe I
will be able to use it in my character controller to detect objects.

Now I need data to put in the octree. 3D Perlin Noise should do. I found this package in NuGet
https://github.com/otac0n/RandomAccessPerlinNoise, but it has no instructions on how to use it and the code has no
comments, so it's borderline useless.

- 13:44		I finally discovered Godot has a built-in FastNoiseLite class that helps generating noise of different types,
inclusing Perlin noise, Worley noise, Voronoi diagrams, Simplex noise, and more.
- 14:59		**Checkpoint 1: Drawing 3D dots on screen** I lost some time figuring out how to show the points generated by
the noise on screen. Unfortunately, Godot don't have API (or at least I didn't found) for debug drawing stuff on 3D
space. I know it has support for custom 2D drawing using the `CanvasItem._Draw()`, but I didn't found anything similar
for 3D. I settled on using a Godot addon called Debug Draw 3D (https://github.com/DmitriySalnikov/godot_debug_draw_cs).
- 15:10		DebugDraw3D was working well when I was making a single call to draw all points at the same time, but once I
split into separate calls for each color from the noise image, it dropped to 10 fps.
- 15:34		**Checkpoint 2: 3D Perlin draw with white dots** I filtered the voxels by a threshold and went back to
drawing the dots with a single call to DebugDraw3D, and now I can see the 3D Perlin noise shapes.
- 15:54		Now comes the real challenge... To mesh the noise, and draw it in 60 fps. I have never done this type of
dynamic meshing before.

- 00:36		**Checkpoint 3x** I'm using Godot's SurfaceTool tool to build a Mesh out of marching cube lookup table. It's
	still a little buggy. I decided to commit a few different versions of it to showcase some failed attempts.
	Also, after making some research, I discovered a few variations of the Marching Cubes algorithm, so I decided to
	make my code flexible about the meshing algorithm. The idea is that I can come back and implement other meshing
	algorithms and compare their performance and generated mesh.
- 13:16		I just found out Godot uses negative Z values for "forward". This might be messing with the calculations
- 22:12		At this point, the surface is being correctly meshed—or at least the surface triangles are being correctly
	positioned—but it was impossible to properly see the geometry because the surface was not being shaded—it was a flat
	color. I messed with the material used for the mesh, but even after enabling shading on the material, the mesh was
	still flat. I tried downloading a random material from the internet but the surface remained flat. At first, I
	thought it had something to do with lighting, but I created a new cube in the scene and applied the same material to
	the cube and it was rendered properly, so I deduced it was something to so with the mesh and not the material or the
	light. I went back to the documentation for the SurfaceTool class—the tool I used to build the mesh—and then I found
	a method called GenerateNormals. I had no idea normals had to be pre-calculated and baked into the meshj; much less
	that I had to manually tell the SurfaceTool to do it. Thankfully, it was just a matter of calling a method and it
	calculated the normals for all triangles in the mesh automatically, and now I could properly see the geometry of the
	mesh I generated, even without a material applied. (I mean, it looked like foam without a material applied, but at
	least it was shaded properly, so I can see the geometry of the mesh)

### 03/01/2023
- 00:48		**Checkpoint 4: Implemented Minecraft meshing algorithm** I implemented Minecraft meshing algorithm to
	compare the result of the marching cube with the simple block-based algorithm.
- 10:08		**Checkpoint 4a** Since I added Minecraft meshing algorithm, I've been annoyed that the shadows look off.
	The game is rendering smooth shadows and smoothly lighting surfaces, but I wanted flat shadows—I want every mesh
	that face the same direction to be shaded equally in every pixel. I also want stronger shadows close to the edges of
	the surfaces that connect to other cubes—I think it's called ambient occlusion—but nothing happens when I turn
	ambient occlusion on on the mesh's material.
	I was also annoyed with how textures looked when I added textures that have a set orientation (e.g. the texture must
	be rendered in the correct orientation otherwise it look to be sideways or upside-down), so I took the time to
	experiment with setting the UV coordinates of vertexes and I finally managed to learned how UV work. I was able to
	setup the mesh so that the textures are correctly oriented on the side faces of the cubes.
	I still have to learn how to make so that I can use a different texture for the top and bottom face of the texture.
	I know I could setup the UVs in a way that it would read different parts of the texture for top, side, and bottom
	faces of the mesh, but this would be less flexible, since I would have to build textures in a very specific way to
	texture the cubes properly. I'm using Kenny assets and the textures for each face of the cube is separate from each
	other. I want to setup the cube material so that I can use these assets without having to open Gimp to merge all the
	separate textures into one.
- 18:34		**Checkpoint 5** The "problem" (not really a problem, just a style preference) with the shadows was being
	caused by the automatically generated normals. (normals were being generated with
	`Godot.SurfaceTool.GenerateNormals`) The automatic algorithm would create diagonal normals at the edges of the mesh.
	(even though the geometry always have angles multiple of 90 degrees) I added normal vectors manually to each surface
	of the mesh (it was easy to do for the Minecraft rendering algorithm because all surfaces are aligned with one of
	the three axis) and the surfaces were shaded as I would expect from a model made up of cubes.
	I also discovered that Meshes can have multiple materials. I can set different materials for the side, top, and
	bottom surfaces of the generated meshes.
